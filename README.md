# Oompa GG

## Problem
Being a schoolgirl and a gamer, Pushpa does not have adequate time to manually go around the entire factory overseeing all the activities being performed. Moreover, being 11 years old, she lacks the
experience and expertise required to manage a factory. The Oompa Loompas do not have any incentive to be efficient and Pushpa has the giant burden of making sure all the operations are carried out smoothly.

## Solution
Our solution to this is OompaGG, a mobile web app that will automate the verification of certain tasks performed by the Oompa Loompas. Along with that, we are gamifying the whole process to incentivise them to complete the maximum number of tasks by providing rewards on their completion.
Lastly, to prevent attempts at falsifying the verification, we are storing all their submissions so that when Pushpa rewards them, she has the option to check the legitimacy of their completions.

## About the platform
OompaGG consists of 2 different web apps; one for employees, and one for the admin. The employees' web app contains the tasks to be done, task details, a leaderboard, and a profile view for the employees to view their wallets. The admin dashboard is for the manager to add tasks, see the leaderboard, and check on the employees' statuses on a real-time updating map.
